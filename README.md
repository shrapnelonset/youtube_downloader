# Youtube Downloader Desktop

### Purpose
I wanted to have a Youtube Downloader. Something that was private, doesn't have ads, and isn't dependent on someone else. I know there are many youtube downloaders on the internet, but I think, in general, we have become a society comfortable with convenience. We want tools to help us do things and we want them to be free. That's all well and good, I like free tools, but what are we giving up? How are we exposing ourselves to get the free things? What information are we giving to websites when we use their tools? What images and videos are we exposing ourselves to?

This tool is a small thing in the grand scheme of the internet and adblockers do a lot to help. But if I have to put on my "armor" and put up my guards to open web browser and search for things, that's not fun and it doesn't feel safe. And it's certainly not what I want for my kids. I want them to be able to safely use computers and the internet without being exposed to something they shouldn't be or constantly have advertisements thrown at them. 

I've never created anything like this before and I'm not a front end designer so I know this is a little rough. Feel free to contribute.
